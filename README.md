# Collaborative Development Experience
## Qualitative Question Sample
We structured our motivational case study to address the following questions during each interview session:

- Q1: What is the day-to-day work routine for the specific role at SAP?
- Q2: What challenges did they encounter?
- Q3: What are the existing solutions or workarounds for these challenges?
## Qualitative Results:
### Q1: Collaboration Persona
Group goals:  Continuously refine and deliver product increments to customers while improving the collaboration process

Group work style: 
- Executives make decisions by evaluating teams through qualitative or quantitative data about product and process
- Program manager communicates group’s overall delivery plan and status regularly with six scrum teams across three time zones
- Developers work on artifact and communicate blockers, status, and needs with all the other roles
- Scrum masters work with developers to understand their sprint goal, status, manage and remove the blockers, escalate if necessary

Collaboration needs: 
- Maintain awareness of group and sprint goals, blockers, and status across time zones and scrum teams.
- Obtain teams' overview to evaluate current process, practices, and artifact quality

## Implementation Details
### Implementation
Our tool consists of three components, as shown in below figure, which include 
1. a data engineering service in Python that monitors and updates data in real time, and particularly consumes data from two external data sources including Jira and GitHub;
2. a structured graph database that contains structured and formatted data entries;
3. a web server that queries and exposes these data as APIs including a dashboard frontend that visualizes the socio-technical dependencies and presents active work items for software developers.

### Visualization of graph database Neo4j
Below visualization is generated by Neo4J when querying a specific team and its corresponding team members and their Jira Issue.
